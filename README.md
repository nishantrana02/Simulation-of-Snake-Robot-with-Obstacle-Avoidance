# Simulation-of-Snake-Robot-with-Obstacle-Avoidance
This project extends the ACMR Snake Robot with obstacle avoidance in CoppeliaSim. Using a proximity sensor, the robot detects objects within 0.4m and adjusts its vertical joints to respond dynamically. The system ensures smooth movement while avoiding collisions.
